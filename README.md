Data analysis of two-photon imaging
This toolbox is an open-source MATLAB program used for two-photon imaging data analysis. This toolbox is demonstrated in the paper "Tonotopy is not preserved in a descending stage of auditory cortex".

Usage
1. data_boxplot.m:
This function is used to analyze differences between different groups
2. detect_ca.m:
This function is used to detect calcium transient event.
3. get_amplitude.m:
This function is used to calculate the amplitude of calcium signal.
4. get_duration.m:
This function is used to calculate the duration of calcium signal.
5. get_half_width.m:
This function is used to calculate the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of calcium signal.
6. get_synch_number.m:
This function is used to calculate synchronize trace number of calcium signal. 
7. save_data.m:
This function is used to save all the results. 
8. save_figure.m:
The function is used to save figures.

*The software was tested on MATLAB R2014a version.
